# Striker HIGH SCHOOL CS120 JAVA ASSIGNMENT

# Write a program that could be used to play a simple game.  Give your game a name.  

The program should first ask one user to supply a positive integer less than 1000.  Once this user has provided an appropriate value, the program should then ask a second user to guess the number that was given by the first user.  After each incorrect guess, the program should tell this user whether the guess was too low or too high and ask for another guess.  The guessing should continue until the second user has found the correct number.  The program should then print the number of guesses that the second user needed to determine the number.

# Output might look like:

Welcome to Strikerâ€”a guessing game!

Player one please enter the number to be guessed: 

Player two guess a number:

Your guess is too low!  Please try again.

Your guess is too low!  Please try again.

Your guess is too high!  Try a lower number.

Your guess is too high!  Try a lower number.

Your guess is too high!  Try a lower number.

Congratulations, you guessed it!

It took 5 guesses to determine the number.
